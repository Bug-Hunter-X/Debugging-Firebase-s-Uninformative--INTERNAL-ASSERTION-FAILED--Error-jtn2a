The Firebase SDKs sometimes throws an error that is not very informative, such as 'Error: INTERNAL ASSERTION FAILED'. This error can occur due to many reasons and is difficult to debug. For instance, it might happen if there is a race condition in the code that interacts with Firebase.  Another cause might be an unexpected state in the Firebase Realtime Database, such as an invalid data structure or a corrupted node. Another reason is the problem in the firebase configuration file.
